# Property Plus

PPâ„¢ is a CRUD application to help keep track of properties, owners, agents and reservations in a convenient to use package. 

Made for ICS 499 at Metropolitan State University to better understand design patterns and how to use GitHub as a team.

## Installation
Developed using Windows and ran in local environments. A standalone jar was never made so you will have to run from your preferred IDE.
### Windows
 #### Software needed
  * Install the database ([MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) or CMD) 
  * Local server ([MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)).

#### Steps
1. Add sqlFile.sql to MySQL workbench from the 'resources/sql' folder to install database.
2. By default, the local MySQL server should be running. (If not, run this command in the CMD - "net start mysql") 
3. Either fork or download and load into your preferred IDE to run. 
4. Look at the sqlFile.sql to see the passwords of the accounts. The admin account has full control over the program while the other accounts are limited.
